##### Professional Experience

I’m a cybersecurity specialist based in Poland with over 5 years of offensive and defensive security experience.

I currently work at **[SECURITUM](https://www.securitum.com/)** as a **Penetration Tester**, performing security assessments across variety of technologies.

Outside of my full-time role, I also take on select independent projects through my own company, when availability allows.
